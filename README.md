The game we developed is called "Rapid Roll". It’s a basic 2D game inspired by Nokia-1600. It’s a simple fun game to play, where player has to control a red ball and land on rectangular platforms by avoiding spikes. Spikes generate randomly alongside the rectangular bar. Rectangular bar and spikes move upwards. There is a fixed spike on the top of the game. If the ball touches the spike, then the game will end. But there is an option available to continue the game even after hitting the spikes. In the game an option is available called life which is symbolized by a heart sign. Heart will generate randomly and the heart gets consumed upon touching by the ball. Once you consume a heart extra life will be added. Number of hearts will determine how many times touching the spike will be ignored. After there are no more hearts are left for that reason, the game will end and score will be stored. Players can see their previous result from high score by returning to the main menu. Music and playing sound can be turned on and off.
Developing this game was a group project. We faced many problems when we develop it. When we faced a problem, we discuss about the problem and overcome from the problem by taking help from one another in the group. This project also helped us to grow a stronger friendship between us as we spent a lot of time working on it. ❤️❤️
